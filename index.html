    <h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
    <p>I'm a Front-end and <span class="aspire">aspiring</span> iOS developer. One of the things I really love about what I do - which I also consider the most important factor in my work - is creating awesome <strong>user experience</strong>.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm freelancing, helping businesses and individuals establish an online presence. Working in a fast-paced and always-evolving environment like the Web industry, I try to sharpen my skill set and stay updated with current trends in the industry. Enter, stage right, <a href="www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a></p>
    <p>Being productive is very important to me. Making every second count, seizing every opportunity, ending each day with some sense of fulfillment.</p>
